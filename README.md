# Ha-r-ckerology
Information for participant in Ha(r)ckeology CAA workshop

Download and install the following application/software:

OpenRefine 2.6 https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases

Tabula https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula

If someone has not a GIS software installed in his/her laptop, I suggest to install qGIS 2.6.1,which is still the more stable version: http://qgis.org/downloads/

A web browser (Chrome is more stable with OpenRefine than Mozilla Firefox)

A spreadsheet (Calc or Excel)


See you in Siena
